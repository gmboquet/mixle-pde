"""Geometry by level sets: shape optimization and inverse shape inference (phase 3).

A shape is represented implicitly by a level-set field ``phi``: the interior is ``{phi > 0}`` and the
boundary is ``{phi = 0}``. A material property is read off it with a smoothed Heaviside,
``material = outside + (inside - outside) * H(phi)`` (``ops.level_set``), which is differentiable in
``phi`` -- so the same adjoint machinery that recovers a coefficient field recovers a *shape*.

Two uses, both reusing the PDE forward operators and adjoints:

- Inverse shape inference (Bayesian): make ``phi`` a ``GP`` field and a forward model read its level-set
  material; ``joint([...]).fit(...)`` returns a posterior over ``phi``, hence over the shape and its
  uncertainty. No new fitting machinery -- it is a field inverse problem with a Heaviside link.
- Shape optimization (deterministic design): :func:`shape_optimize` minimizes a design objective (drag,
  compliance, misfit-to-target) over ``phi`` by L-BFGS on the adjoint gradients, with an optional
  smoothness prior to keep the boundary well-behaved.
