"""Fail closed when a commit in the release range carries authorship this project does not claim.

The release ledger records author/committer identities, but that check reads only ``%an``/``%cn``:
a ``Co-Authored-By:`` trailer naming a tool sits in the message BODY and passes it untouched. The
0.7.0 line shipped with forty such trailers and needed a history rewrite to remove them, which
changed every commit SHA from mid-2026 -- so this is expensive to fix late and cheap to prevent.

The rules deliberately separate ATTRIBUTION from SUBJECT MATTER. This library legitimately discusses
``openai/clip-vit-base-patch32``, ``OpenAICompatLLM``, ``mixle/reason/llm.py``, ``REQ-AI-OPERABILITY``
and "ten AI adversarial reviews"; a check that flagged those would be turned off within a week. What
is refused is a claim of authorship: an unrecognised ``*-by:`` trailer, a tool's e-mail address, a
generated-by advertisement, or a bare vendor name, which has no reason to appear in this project's
commit messages at all. Since 2026-09-29 the bare word "AI" is refused too, by the owner's rule for
every repository in the family: the same file, with the same rules, runs in each member's CI.
