"""sphinx-polyversion configuration: builds versioned docs (tags + main) into one site.

Run with ``sphinx-polyversion docs/poly.py``. Each matched git ref is checked out into its own
temporary venv, ``mixle-pde[docs]`` is installed there, and its ``docs/`` tree is built with
``sphinx-build`` into ``OUTPUT_DIR/<ref-name>/``. ``versions.json`` (the list of built refs) lands
at ``OUTPUT_DIR/versions.json``; ``docs/_templates/sidebar/version-switcher.html`` reads it
client-side to render the version dropdown (Furo has no host-agnostic switcher of its own -- its
built-in one is Read the Docs-specific), so it works uniformly across every built version, including
tags whose own ``conf.py`` predates this setup. ``docs/_root_templates/index.html`` is rendered once
at the site root and redirects ``/`` to whichever built version is newest (see that file's comment
for why this is dynamic rather than a hardcoded branch name, unlike core `mixle`'s copy of this
template -- `main` has no `docs/` tree yet, so it isn't matched by the predicate below at all).

Iterate locally with ``sphinx-polyversion -l docs/poly.py`` (builds only the working tree, no other
refs) before running the real multi-version build, which is slower (one venv + full doc build per ref).
